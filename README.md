# Medical Data Visualizer

This data analysis and visualization project was completed as part of the freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification. The project explores a dataset of patient medical records to visualize the relationship between various health indicators and cardiovascular disease.

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Add an "overweight" column based on BMI.
- Normalize data for cholesterol and glucose.
- Create a **categorical plot** to show counts of certain health features grouped by cardiovascular disease presence.
- Create a **heatmap** to display correlations between various medical features.

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset `medical_examination.csv` includes features like age, gender, height, weight, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, glucose, and lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity), as well as whether the patient has cardiovascular disease.

## 📈 Visualizations

- **Categorical Plot**: Shows the count of patients by feature (e.g., smoke, alco, overweight) split by cardiovascular disease status.
- **Heatmap**: Displays a correlation matrix of all numerical features after cleaning the data.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn installed.
3. Run the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Execute the functions `draw_cat_plot()` and `draw_heat_map()` to generate and save the plots.
